//! MJCF loading and rendering for MuJoCo scenes.
//!
//! MuJoCo owns parsing and forward kinematics; the engine never computes a
//! pose itself -- it only reads geom poses each frame and draws what MuJoCo
//! reports. Primitive geoms are wireframed here (see `draw_mj_geom`);
//! mesh geoms are drawn as real triangle meshes by the caller, from the .obj
//! the MJCF names (see [`MujocoScene::mesh_geoms`], which `draw_mj_geom`
//! can't do itself -- it has a `Renderer` but no `AssetManager`).
//!
//! Two very different MuJoCo builds back this depending on target:
//!   - native: `mujoco-rs`, an FFI binding to the C library, driven directly
//!     by [`MujocoScene`].
//!   - wasm32: `mujoco-rs` can't target `wasm32-unknown-unknown` (it's FFI to
//!     a native binary). Instead the page loads DeepMind's official
//!     `@mujoco/mujoco` wasm build as a second, independent wasm module, and
//!     steps it in its own requestAnimationFrame loop in JS. Each frame it
//!     copies the geom arrays into this module's `wasm_bridge` via
//!     wasm-bindgen; [`MujocoScene::tick_and_draw`] just reads whatever the
//!     bridge last received and draws it. Two separate wasm linear memories
//!     means this copy is unavoidable -- there's no way to share pointers
//!     across the boundary. `examples/mujoco_test/index.html` is the JS half
//!     of this handoff.
//!
//! The split runs deeper than stepping. Native MuJoCo opens an MJCF's
//! `<include>`s and meshes off the filesystem itself; the wasm build has no
//! filesystem, so [`MujocoScene::load_bundle`] gathers every file the model
//! needs up front and the JS half stages them into MuJoCo's in-memory FS
//! before loading. Trajectory playback splits the same way: native writes
//! `qpos` through mujoco-rs, while wasm reads the joint layout JS reported at
//! load ([`MujocoScene::joint_tracks`]) and sends resolved qpos addresses
//! back for JS to write ([`MujocoScene::apply_trajectory_frame`]).
